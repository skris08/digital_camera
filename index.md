## Digital Cameras

Digital cameras are widely employed in numerous applications, such as 
1. advanced still cameras,
2. camcorders,
3. camera telephones, and 
4. video observations.

The camera which captures sensible images with adjusted parameters:

```markdown
saturation,
brightness,
contrast,
```
and so forth bringing about top notch picture is driving in the market.

## Camera frameworks

```markdown
The objective of a Camera framework is to capture a scene and imitate the caught scene in a digital format.
The Camera Sensor incorporates lens, color filter array (Bayer) and a image sensor.
The Bayer sensor filters the light by wavelength range, such that the separate filtered intensities include information about the color of light which are captured in the light bucket and then the ADC converts the electronic signals into digital signals recreating the RAW picture.
The block diagram shows how a scene is seen on the camera sensor and how it is handled to get a raw image from the image sensor.
